msrprelay (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed per-domain configuration and certificates in favour of detecting
    the SIP domain from the To-Path. This assumes SRV records are used to
    look up the MSRP relay. This also elimites the need for using the TLS
    server name extension.
  * Removed any references to CAs and CRLs.
  * Simplified certificate generation.
  * Cleaned up test script directory.
  * Added own runtime directory in /var/run to store runtime files.
  * Added commandline option to specify the name of the config file to read.
  * Fixed the "memory" backend to support domain names.
  * Added username@domain and total session bytecount to logging output.
