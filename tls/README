These scripts provide two ways to generate a certificate:

CA method
---------
- Generate a self-signed CA certificate and key pair using:
  ./gen_ca_creds.sh <ca-common_name>.
- Use the CA certificate and key pair to generate a relay certificate and key
  pair:
  ./gen_relay_creds_ca.sh <msrp-relay-hostname>

The CA certificate could then be handed to the client and used for
certificate verification.

Self-signed method
------------------
- Generate a self-signed certificate and key pair:
  ./gen_relay_creds_self.sh <msrp-relay-hostname>

This should be sufficient for most relays.
