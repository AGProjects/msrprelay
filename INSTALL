Installation
------------

For Debian packages go to:

https://docs-new.sipthor.net/w/debian_package_repositories/

sduo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install msrprelay


If you have installed the debian package you can skip forward to the
'Configure the server' section.

For non Debian installations you must perform the following steps:

 * Download and install dependencies
 * Download and install MSRPRelay


Download and install dependencies
---------------------------------

The software has been developed and tested on Linux Debian unstable
distribution.

The software has the following dependencies:

 * Python 3
 * Twisted
 * SQLObject
 * python3-application http://download.ag-projects.com/SipSimpleSDK/Python3/
 * python-gnutls http://download.ag-projects.com/SipSimpleSDK/Python3/


Download and install MSRP Relay
-------------------------------

The software can be downloaded as a tar archive from:

http://download.ag-projects.com/MSRP/

Extract it using tar xzvf msrprelay-version.tar.gz and change directory to
the newly created msrprelay directory.

The source code is managed using darcs version control tool. The darcs
repository can be fetched with:

darcs clone http://devel.ag-projects.com/repositories/msrprelay


To obtain the incremental changes after the initial get, go to the msrprelay
directory and run:

cd msrprelay
darcs pull -a

Install the software:

cd msrprelay
python3 setup.py install


Configure the server
--------------------

A sample configuration file is provided as config.ini.sample. All configuration
options are documented in this file.

Configure MSRPRelay by copying config.ini.sample to config.ini and editing
it.  At the very least the certificates need to be provided and the
authentication backend needs to be configured.

Generate a TLS certificate/key pair. For documentation on how to do this,
see the "tls" directory.

Typically, both TLS certificate/key pair and configuration file would be
installed in /etc/msrprelay. This is not needed however, as MSRPRelay looks
for the configuration file in its local directory. Alternatively, the
configuration filename and location may be specified on the command line
using the --config-file option.

If you don't have a running user database to connect to you can test using
the in-memory backend as described.

The software will reload its configuration file when it receives the HUP
signal. All of the already established sessions will continue to operate using
the old settings until a disconnection occurs within this session. This allows
for changes in the configuration without disruption of service.

Note: at this moment the backend configurations are not re-read.


Configure the DNS
-----------------

For each domain served by the relay the following DNS record must be added to
the name servers authoritative for the domain:

_msrps._tcp.example.com. IN SRV	0 0 2855 msrprelay.example.com.
msrprelay.example.com. IN A 10.0.0.1

Replace the domain name, hostname and IP address with the real ones.


Running the server
------------------

Start the MSRPRelay, either by executing:

sudo ./msrprelay --no-fork

or as a daemon, which is the default behaviour.

This can also be done using the systemd script:

sudo systemctl start msrprelay

When started as a deamon MSRPRelay will log its messages to syslog.


Testing the server
------------------

The "test/" directory contains a number of test scripts and a simple file
transfer sender and receiver. See the README in the "test/" directory for
documentation on the latter.

You can use Blink client for IM and file Transfer from http://icanblink.com
or comand line tools from SIP Simple Client SDK http://sipsimpleclient.com.
